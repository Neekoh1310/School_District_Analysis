# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the student disctrict analysis file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Maria has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of teh data intact. Once I've replaced the math and reading scores, I will repeat the school district analysis to write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis. Here are the steps that I will have to take to complete this analysis.

1. Replace all the Thomas High School 9th Grade math and reading scores to NaNs.
2. Subtract these NaN scores from the overall math, reading and both percentages of the grades.
3. Compare the new percentages to the original percentages.
4. Compare the top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools from the new analysis with the old analysis.
5. Determine and describe the changes that occured by re-running the analysis.
